= Quarkus Context Propagation

== Story
As a developer

* I would like to add a variable to the `MDC`-Context in a filter

.Filter definition
[source,java]
----
include::./src/main/java/de/turing85/quarkus/context/propagation/AddValueToMdcFilter.java[]
----

* and be able to access it in my REST-endpoint:

.Usage in Endpoint
[source,java]
----
include::./src/main/java/de/turing85/quarkus/context/propagation/MdcEndpoint.java[]
----

== Current state
If we build (`mvn package`), we see that the test fails. In the logs, we see:

.Log output from test
[source, log]
----
2022-06-04 17:23:24,518 INFO  [de.tur.qua.con.pro.AddValueToMdcFilter] [FOO=foo] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) Key "FOO" with value "foo" is now in MDC
[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 8.249 s <<< FAILURE! - in de.turing85.MdcEndpointTest

java.lang.AssertionError:
1 expectation failed.
Expected status code <200> but was <204>.

We can see that the filter sets the value correctly, and the value is present in the `MDC`. But in the Endpoint class, the value is not available.
